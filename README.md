## **_A simple GraphQL server built on top of Adonis.js_**

Uses Adonis and [Adonis Apollo Server](https://github.com/ammezie/adonis-apollo-server) for a GraphQL API to query and run mutations on 'Post' and 'User' models. The endpoint is most easily tested with a client such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

With Adonis.js installed globally, `adonis serve --dev` will start the API server for testing.
